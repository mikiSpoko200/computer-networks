 * of message is received. Thus, we need only one set of parameters that is:
 *  - round trip time (RRT)
 *  - ip address of the sender
 * In case of Time Exceeded Message however we need to collect more samples in order to better estimate round trip time.
 * Now we can possibly get response from few different hosts, we don't want any duplicates tho.
 * This is the purpose of ip_addresses and unique_address_count fields.
 * First stores unique sender addresses and second is the count of stored addresses (length of ip_addresses).
 * round_trip_times stores RRT's for all received packets and collected_packets is the final number of collected packets.
